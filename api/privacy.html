  <h1>Privacy Policy for Unpack</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 15, 2024</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>Unpack ("we", "our", or "us") is a Chrome Extension dedicated to simplifying text content on the web. We respect
    your privacy and are committed to protecting it.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not collect personal identification information (PII) such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers. The
    extension only processes data explicitly selected by you.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Content:</strong> When you use the "Unpack this" feature, the specific text you selected is sent to
      our server to be processed by an AI model.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous metrics (e.g., number of requests) to ensure service
      stability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>The text you select is used solely for the purpose of generating a simplified summary. This data is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sent securely (via HTTPS) to our processing server.</li>
    <li>Forwarded to a third-party AI provider (e.g., Anthropic or Google) for simplification.</li>
    <li><strong>NOT</strong> permanently stored on our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>NOT</strong> sold to third parties or used for advertising.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We rely on trusted third-party LLM providers to perform the text simplification. Their privacy practices are
    governed by their respective policies.</p>

  <h2>5. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this policy, please contact us via the Chrome Web Store support page.</p>
